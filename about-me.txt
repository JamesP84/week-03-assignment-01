Bio:

My name is James Pappadis and I am currently an IT Major at Loyola University of Chicago.  Prior to returning back to school, I worked within the field of education for the past 10 years.  I’m currently making this career change into IT as my interest in technology has been constantly evolving over the years.  Throughout the past I’ve used many different technologies, including SMART Board technologies, graphic design tools, and I’ve also used Word Press to assist with website development.  Another interesting experience that I had was when I was contracted by Google to work on a social media pilot program that they were developing.  The pilot program specifically sought to implement customer service via Twitter for Google Cloud and Google Cloud Platform users.  I found all these experiences to be very exciting and they all contributed to my desire to go back to school to study IT.  So far, I’ve really enjoyed my experiences in learning IT at Loyola, and I’m excited to continue on with my studies.
